# Latest-Firebase-Cloud-Messaging-Code

The latest Firebase Messaging package implements many breaking changes and this template project provides a clear understanding of how to handle FCM. I have tried to comment the code to my maximum capabilities. Also refer to FlutterXFire's documentation for FCM
